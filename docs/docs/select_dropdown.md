# Select Dropdown Field

## Overview
The **Select Dropdown Field** provides users with a **dropdown menu** of choices. It is useful for compact and structured selection.

## Usage Example
Use a **select dropdown** when there are many options, such as selecting a country.

### Example Form Configuration
```json
{
    "type": "select",
    "label": "Select Your Country",
    "options": ["USA", "Canada", "UK", "Germany", "France"],
    "required": true
}
```

This field prevents users from entering invalid data manually.
